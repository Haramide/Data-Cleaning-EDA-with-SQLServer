### Data-Cleaning-with-SQLServer
This is a project i analysed and wrangled starting as a data analyst with AlexTheAnalyst tutorial video.

### Project-1 CovidDeath EDA
* Obtained CovidDeath Dataset. LINK #<https://1drv.ms/x/s!Aj9-mD0uRfMjhz2G42lIXfJS4zmq?e=BN33aX>
* Prepared Dataset using Microsoft Excel i.e converting csv file to an Excel workbook file.
* Import dataset into SQLServer.
* Dataset did not require cleaning so i did my Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA).
*  Discovered where #INT needs to be converted to #BIGINT.
